# Timelapse Timer

This is a small utility that will calculate the time taken for a screen recording timelapse by detecting the time between each file and removing any large gaps.

The files should be in a folder called `count` and should be named with the following format: `'2021-05-25_020220_as.jpg'`. This is the output of the automatic screenshoter program on windows.
